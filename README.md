Managed a $5 million portfolio in a data science midterm project, implementing a "buy low" trading strategy with a 5-day rebalancing protocol, 
analyzing historical stock data for 10 major companies. Developed and compared strategies, created indices, and utilized programming tools (R/Python) 
to optimize portfolio performance and visualize data trends against market benchmarks.

Worked in a group setting with 3 others, and had difficulty configuring the last part of the problem.
